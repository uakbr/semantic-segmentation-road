Welcome to the Semantic Segmentation for Road Scene Understanding project! This project aims to develop a state-of-the-art deep learning model for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation of road scenes. By leveraging the power of the DeepLabv3+ architecture and the Cityscapes dataset, we enable precise pixel-wise classification of objects and regions in complex urban environments.

## Introduction

Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. In the context of road scene understanding, semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in enabling autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems to perceive and interpret their surroundings. By accurately identifying and localizing objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, road markings, and traffic signs, semantic segmentation provides a detailed understanding of the road scene, facilitating safer and more efficient navigation.

This project utilizes the DeepLabv3+ architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model known for its exceptional performance in semantic segmentation tasks. DeepLabv3+ combines the strengths of spatial pyramid pooling and encoder-decoder structures to capture multi-scale contextual information and produce fine-grained segmentation maps. By training the model on the Cityscapes dataset, which contains high-quality annotated images of urban street scenes, we aim to achieve accurate and robust semantic segmentation of road scenes.

## Features

- **State-of-the-Art Architecture**: The project employs the DeepLabv3+ architecture, which has demonstrated superior performance in semantic segmentation tasks across various domains.
- **Cityscapes Dataset**: The model is trained on the widely-used Cityscapes dataset, ensuring its applicability to real-world urban environments.
- **Efficient Inference**: The implemented model is optimized for efficient inference, enabling real-time semantic segmentation of road scenes.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The project includes thorough evaluation metrics and tools to assess the model's performance, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and per-class IoU.
- **Inference on Images and Videos**: The trained model can be easily applied to perform semantic segmentation on both images and videos, providing flexibility in usage.
- **Web Application**: An interactive web application is included, allowing users to upload images or videos and visualize the semantic segmentation results.
- **Extensibility**: The project is designed to be modular and extensible, facilitating further experimentation and improvements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7.0 or higher
- CUDA (if using GPU)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Clone the Repository

To clone this repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-segmentation-road.git
cd semantic-segmentation-road
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

### Cityscapes Dataset

This project utilizes the Cityscapes dataset for training and evaluation. To use the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Cityscapes dataset website](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) and request access to the dataset.
2. Once granted access, download the dataset and extract it to a directory of your choice.
3. Update the `data_dir` variable in the configuration file (`config.yaml`) to point to the directory containing the Cityscapes dataset.

### Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, preprocess the Cityscapes dataset by running the following command:

```bash
python data/preprocess.py --config config.yaml
```

This script will convert the dataset into a format suitable for training and save the preprocessed data in the specified output directory.

## Model Training

### Configuration

The training configuration can be adjusted by modifying the `config.yaml` file. This file contains various hyperparameters and settings, such as the learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and data directories. Make sure to review and update the configuration according to your requirements.

### Training

To train the semantic segmentation model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

This script will load the preprocessed dataset, initialize the DeepLabv3+ model, and start the training process. The trained model checkpoints will be saved in the specified `checkpoint_dir` directory.

### Monitoring Training Progress

During training, you can monitor the progress using TensorBoard. Run the following command in a separate terminal:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir runs
```

This will launch TensorBoard, and you can view the training metrics, loss curves, and visualizations by opening the provided URL in a web browser.

## Model Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics

The project employs several evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the trained model, including:

- **Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)**: The average IoU across all classes, providing an overall measure of segmentation accuracy.
- **Per-Class IoU**: The IoU calculated for each individual class, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the model's performance on specific object categories.

### Running Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model on the test set, run the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config config.yaml --checkpoint_path /path/to/checkpoint.pth
```

This script will load the specified model checkpoint and evaluate its performance on the test set using the defined evaluation metrics. The evaluation results will be displayed in the console and saved to a log file.

## Inference

### Inference on Images

To perform semantic segmentation on individual images, run the following command:

```bash
python inference.py --config config.yaml --checkpoint_path /path/to/checkpoint.pth --image_path /path/to/image.jpg --output_path /path/to/output.jpg
```

This script will load the trained model checkpoint, apply semantic segmentation to the specified image, and save the segmented output image to the designated output path.

### Inference on Videos

To perform semantic segmentation on videos, run the following command:

```bash
python inference_video.py --config config.yaml --checkpoint_path /path/to/checkpoint.pth --video_path /path/to/video.mp4 --output_path /path/to/output.mp4
```

This script will load the trained model checkpoint, apply semantic segmentation to each frame of the input video, and save the segmented output video to the specified output path.

## Web Application

The project includes a web application that allows users to upload images or videos and visualize the semantic segmentation results interactively.

### Running the Web Application

To run the web application, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the web application server, and you can access it by opening the provided URL in a web browser.

### Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Upload an image or video file using the provided file upload interface.
3. Click the "Segment" button to perform semantic segmentation on the uploaded file.
4. The segmented output will be displayed on the webpage, along with the original input file.
5. You can download the segmented output by clicking the "Download" button.

## Results and Visualization
